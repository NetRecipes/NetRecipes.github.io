## My Focus

I specialize in **Cloud-Native, Distributed Systems** that are portable, scalable, and cloud-agnostic. My work centers on helping developers build production-ready applications using modern patterns and frameworks, with a particular emphasis on:

- **DAPR** (Distributed Application Runtime) - Following since 2019
- **.NET Aspire** - Cloud-native orchestration and developer experience
- **Microsoft Technologies** - Deep expertise in the .NET ecosystem

## Why NetRecipes?

NetRecipes is my platform for sharing practical, hands-on knowledge about building distributed systems. Each course and recipe is designed to bridge the gap between theory and real-world implementation, focusing on:

- Abstraction and portability across cloud providers
- Developer productivity and maintainable architectures
- Production-ready patterns for distributed applications

The content you'll find here reflects years of architecting solutions and tackling real challenges in cloud-native development.
