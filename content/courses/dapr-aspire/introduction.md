## 📘 Overview

This course is a **cookbook for modern .NET developers**.  
Each chapter is a recipe that teaches a core concept of **cloud‑native, distributed systems** using **.NET Aspire** and **DAPR**.  
Instead of full demo applications with extra boilerplate, we’ll use **simple service examples** — like *ServiceA* and *ServiceB* — to keep the focus on the building blocks themselves:

- [ ] 📒 State Management
- [ ] 📞 Service Invocation
- [ ] 📨 Pub‑Sub
- [ ] ⚙️ Configurations
- [ ] 🔐 Secrets
- [ ] ⏱️ Bindings
- [ ] 📈 Observability with Aspire Dashboard
- [ ] 📦 Deployment to Kubernetes and Azure

## ⚡ What is Aspire

**.NET Aspire** is Microsoft’s framework for building **cloud‑native applications**.  
You can think of it as *Docker‑Compose, but better* — it not only orchestrates services, but also adds built‑in support for configuration, observability, and deployment, making distributed application design smoother and more consistent.

## 🔹 What is DAPR

**DAPR (Distributed Application Runtime)**, as the name suggests, provides **building blocks for distributed systems** — state management, pub‑sub messaging, service invocation, bindings, and secrets.  
It abstracts away infrastructure details so you can focus on designing resilient systems without reinventing the plumbing.

> 👉 Together, `Aspire` and `DAPR` are the **ingredients** of this course.
By combining them, you’ll learn how to assemble scalable, future‑ready .NET systems step by step.
